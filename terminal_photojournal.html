  <h1>Hampton Roads Terminals</h1>
  <h2>A Photojournal</h2>
  <p>Hampton Roads has beautiful terminals.<br>
  This project will exhibit the variety<br>
  of locations around Hampton Roads<br>
  where you can observe the cranes<br>
  that serve as landmarks.<br>
  Some of the places that the terminals<br>
  can be viewed from may be surprising.<br>
  Some of the places that the terminals<br>
  can be viewed from are also very far.</p>
  <h2>Monitor Merrimac Bridge Tunnel</h2>
  <p>On this evening the<br>
  Norfolk International Terminal (NIT)<br>
  was more illuminated that the<br>
  Portsmouth Marine Terminal (PMT).</p>
