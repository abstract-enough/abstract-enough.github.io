    <h1>Hacking an Automaton</h1>
    <p>This page is about hacking computers<br>
      that are less powerful than Turing machines.<br>
      I noticed that two Keurig machines have<br>
      the same problem when you refill the reservoir.<br>
      Many people have this specific type of Keurig.<br>
      <img src="nasa_keurig.jpg"><br>
      <p>After refilling the reservoir<br>
      and placing the reservoir into position,<br>
      there is a sound like gears are not<br>
      making a complete connection as the<br>
      machine pulls water into the heating tank.<br>
      When the machine makes this unpleasant sound<br>
      the water does not fill the heat tank.<br>
      The hack I discovered is that if you remove the<br>
      reservoir after the machine starts pulling<br>
      water (when you hear the unpleasant sound)<br>
      and then place the reservoir back into<br>
      position, then the gears will not grind<br>
      and the heat tank will be able to pull the water.</p>
